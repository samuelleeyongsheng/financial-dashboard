Financial Dashboard

Project Status: 🛑 Discontinued
This project is currently inactive. While the core logic and frontend components are functional, I have decided to move on to other projects due to infrastructure limitations regarding the backend execution.

Project Overview
The goal of this project was to create a Python-based financial dashboard to track and visualize financial data. The backend was designed to handle data processing and scheduling tasks to keep the dashboard updated.

Why it was discontinued
The project reached a point where the backend required a persistent server to remain running 24/7 to execute Python scripts based on a specific schedule.

While the logic for the dashboard and data processing is functional, the requirement for a dedicated, always-on server to manage the scheduling was not the ideal direction for this specific build. Rather than maintaining a complex server setup for this version, I am choosing to apply the lessons learned here toward my next projects.

Key Learnings
Backend Scheduling: Gained experience in setting up Python scripts for automated tasks.

Infrastructure Requirements: Better understood the hosting and server-side needs for real-time or scheduled data processing.

Python Development: Improved skills in using Python for financial data manipulation.
